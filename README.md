# Life Events Platform

Welcome to the Life Events Platform, using the [OGCIO](https://www.ogcio.gov.ie/) building blocks.
This repository contains the Live Events application and two Building Blocks: Messaging and Payments.

To read more about the project you can refer to the [Documentation](documentation/docs/) folder.
You can start by reading the [Introduction](documentation/docs/intro.md) which contains the Setup to run this project locally.

In case you want a more interactive experience you can start our web-based documentation just by running: `npm i && npm start:docs`.

The docs application will start usually at `http://localhost:3000`. From there you can setup this repo and read all the technical docs
